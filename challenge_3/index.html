        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <h2>I'm 17 years old and a senior in high school. My favorite video game at the moment is Hollow Knight 
        even though at times I want to toss my Switch across the room. If you couldn't tell from above I want to be
        a biomedical engineer because it would help people in the future. Maybe I'll create
        an organ that could save countless lives but who knows. I plan on going to Michigan Tech (if i get enough money to go)
        because they have a 5-year Masters Degree program. That program would mean that I would get my Masters when I'm 22
        years old. I enjoy painting in my spare time which is rarely now because of college apps. When I have time I fully immerse myself
        to painting becasue the only limit I have is my imagination (and time I guess).
        Well that's me in a nut shell. I'm just your average teen doing something that inspires 
        them and hope to make it in the world. </h2>
